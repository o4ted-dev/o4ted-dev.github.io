        <p>This is the third page of my HTML journey. I am beginning to incorporate CSS Elements. I think that the tricky part is getting things to be just the right size and position.</p>

      <p>I placed the aside up above because the top corner was naked. I tried it here first, but with nothing above it, it stuck out like a sore thumb...</p>

      <h3>Citation</h3>
        <p>Here is a quote from Wasily Kandinsky's <em>On the Problem of Form</em>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://room4truth.com/2011/03/07/on-the-problem-of-form/">
At the appointed time, necessities become ripe. That is the time when the Creative Spirit (which one can also designate as the Abstract Spirit) finds an avenue to the soul, later to other souls, and causes a yearning, an inner urge.
<br>
<br>
This yearning–this inner urge–acquires the power to create in the human spirit a new value which, consciously or unconsciously, begins to live in the human being. From this moment on, consciously or unconsciously, the human being seeks to find a material form for the new value, which already lives within him in spiritual form.
</blockquote>
        <p>I found this essay because it was referenced in Scott McCloud's <a href="https://archive.org/details/understanding-comics">Understanding Comics</a></p>

      <aside><p>Understanding Comics is a fascinating book. It's definitely the sort of book that I recommend reading <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/understanding-comics-scott-mccloud?variant=32122752565282">a physical copy</a> rather than an ebook. I got a copy for $6 at a street sale.</p></aside>
